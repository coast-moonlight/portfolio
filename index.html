      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
            From early experiments on a second-hand laptop in Nigeria to building secure systems in Germany, 
    my journey has always been powered by curiosity and discipline. I‚Äôm Basil Ugbomoiko, 
    an information security analyst and researcher passionate about system integrity, data protection, 
    and the balance between privacy and innovation. With a background in Computer Science and a 
    Master's in IT Security, I bridge the worlds of academia and industry‚Äîtranslating theory into 
    practice, and compliance into culture.

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <ul class="timeline">
    <li>
      <strong>Feb 2025 ‚Äì Jun 2025:</strong> 
      As an Information Security Compliance Analyst at roclub GmbH, Berlin, I maintained ISO 27001-compliant 
      ISMS environments and streamlined GDPR compliance processes‚Äîensuring not just audit readiness, 
      but audit confidence. I transformed policies from ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù into ‚Äútools.‚Äù
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Feb 2024 ‚Äì Mar 2025:</strong> 
      At Universit√§t zu L√ºbeck, I was immersed in the fascinating challenge of securing RISC-V processors. 
      My simulations shaped the foundation for safer embedded systems and fueled my passion for hardware-level trust.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>May 2024 ‚Äì Oct 2024:</strong> 
      During my time at Bauer Media Group, I optimized enterprise software licensing using Snow License Manager. 
      Behind the spreadsheets was a mission: ensure compliance, save costs, and enable tech teams to operate with clarity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jun 2023 ‚Äì Jan 2024:</strong> 
      At automITe-Engineering GmbH, I conducted penetration tests on embedded and web systems‚Äîrevealing 
      vulnerabilities and working closely with dev teams to patch them. It was digital surgery, and I loved the precision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dec 2021 ‚Äì Mar 2022:</strong> 
      At eyeo GmbH, I took on the human side of cybersecurity: phishing awareness and response. Using platforms like soSafe, 
      I educated teams and escalated threats quickly‚Äîmaking security personal and proactive.
    </li>

      <p>
        <strong>RISC-V Keystone Enclave Benchmarking</strong><br/>
    In the age of open hardware, building trust at the chip level is essential. This project benchmarked 
    Keystone enclave configurations on RISC-V to understand the trade-offs between performance and protection. 
    Through careful measurements and empirical tuning, I helped define how to run secure code 
    without breaking the bank on compute costs‚Äîone instruction cycle at a time.
